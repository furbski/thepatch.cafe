# thepatch.cafe

This is the website for a local cafe that I like to go to.

They didn't have one, so here we go. 

Simple one page layout with location, menu, some pictures, opening hours, and a short blurb.

Well, the pictures, hours, blurb and menu are still to come.

The scaffold is final though. Logo, footer, css modifications...

Still need to get it working right though.
